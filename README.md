Repository for my blog post, 'Automated Deployment to GlassFish Using Jenkins CI Server and Apache Ant': http://wp.me/p1RD28-2I

Use Jenkins and Apace Ant to compile, assemble, test, and deploy a RESTful web service to GlassFish.

Note, since the NetBeans nbproject/private folder is specific to your own environment (specifically, your app server), it is not included in the repository. Once you clone and open this project, NetBeans will ask to resolve the missing app server. This will recreate the private folder and it's contents, based on your environment.
