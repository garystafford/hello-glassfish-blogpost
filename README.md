Repository for my blog post, 'Automated Deployment to GlassFish Using Jenkins CI Server and Apache Ant': http://wp.me/p1RD28-2I

Use Jenkins and Apace Ant to compile, assemble, test, and deploy a RESTful web service to GlassFish.

Note, since the NetBeans nbproject/private folder is specific to your own environment (specifically, your app server), it is not included in the repro. Once you clone and open this project, resolve the missing app server. This will recreate teh private folder and it's contents, based on your environment.
